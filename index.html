        <h2>What's it about?</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of Towers of Hanoi is to move a set of discs of different
          sizes from one peg to another while only allowing the player to take
          the top most disc off the peg and not putting a larger disc on top of
          a smaller one. The story goes that priests in a temple move 64 discs
          around 3 pegs to fulfill the prophecy that if they complete their task
          the world will end. Thankfully based on the math that we know, to
          complete this task would take 2^64-1 seconds to complete, or ~585
          billion years.

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            utilize a 2D array to depict and maintain a board with 3 pegs and a
            flexible number of discs.
          </li>
          <li>
            print the board to the console, horizontally, utilizing a map
            function.
          </li>
          <li>
            allow the game to progress with the player submitting moves and the
            game updating the board if the move is allowed, or rejecting it if
            it's an illegal move.
          </li>
          <li>
            maintain the state of the board and track the number of moves the
            player makes
          </li>
          <li>
            at the end of the game, announce the winner and the number of moves
            made and reset for a new game.
          </li>
          <li>
            utilize the map, filter, and reduce array helper methods in the
            implementation
          </li>
